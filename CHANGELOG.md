## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- v1.6.0 — Localhost Dashboard.

  Adds a localhost web dashboard (`swt dashboard`) that renders live SWT project state — phases, plans, summaries, agent timeline, log stream, cost rollups — with a Hono daemon, a Solid SPA, chokidar file-watching, and SSE-driven live updates. UAT CHECKPOINTs can be recorded from the browser. Defence-in-depth localhost-only binding, exponential-backoff SSE reconnect, server-side log rate limiting, client-side artifact virtualization, and bundle-size + offline guards round out the production polish. Implements `non_production_files/UI/TDD.md` end-to-end across 4 phases.

  **Phase 01 — Workspace Foundation and Schema Spike:**
  - New `packages/dashboard/` (Hono server + Solid client) and `packages/dashboard-core/` (shared Zod schemas: `Snapshot`, `SnapshotEvent`, `ApiSchemas`).
  - Vite dev-mode `/api` proxy + tsup server bundle into `dist/dashboard-server.mjs`.
  - SSE round-trip from a dummy event source proven against `EventSource('/api/events')` within 250 ms.

  **Phase 02 — MVP Read-Only Dashboard:**
  - chokidar watcher → debounced snapshot reducer → SSE incremental events.
  - Endpoints `GET /api/snapshot`, `GET /api/events`, `GET /api/artifact?path=...` with path-traversal guard restricted to `.swt-planning/**` + `dist/**` allowlist.
  - Markdown rendered server-side through unified + remark-parse + remark-gfm + remark-rehype + rehype-sanitize + `@shikijs/rehype` + rehype-stringify.
  - Components: TopBar, PhaseStepper, ArtifactTree, ArtifactPreview. CSS tokens derived from `non_production_files/UI/BRANDKIT.md` (terminal-green, deep-void, ghost-white, neon-cyan, warm-amber, danger-red, slate-muted).

  **Phase 03 — Live Event Stream and UAT:**
  - New `packages/cli/src/lifecycle/event-bus.ts` emits structured `.swt-planning/.events/<sessionId>.jsonl` records (5 typed variants: `agent.spawn`, `agent.complete`, `phase.transition`, `qa_gate`, `log.append`) with 50 ms buffered flush.
  - Daemon-side JSONL tailer (chokidar + per-file byte-offset tracking) bridges CLI events through the existing SSE channel.
  - Live UI panels: AgentTimeline (newest-first cards with role colors + tokens/cost/duration), LogPanel (200-line cap + ↓ jump-to-live pill + ANSI parser), CostPanel (three big JetBrains-Mono numbers).
  - SSE exponential-backoff reconnect: `[1000, 2000, 5000, 10000]` ms cap. On second open, fresh `GET /api/snapshot` re-fetch recovers from drift during disconnect.
  - UAT modal + `POST /api/uat/:phase/checkpoint` (Zod-validated body, 200/400/404/409 contract). Repo-level `.gitignore` extended with `.swt-planning/.events/`.

  **Phase 04 — CLI Integration and Polish:**
  - New `swt dashboard` subcommand wired into the CLI registry. Flags: `--port=N`, `--host=H`, `--unsafe-public`, `--no-open`, `--debug`. Free-port picker (54320–54420 then OS-assigned fallback).
  - **AC-14 binding guard, defence-in-depth:** both the CLI command and the server boot path refuse non-loopback bindings unless `--unsafe-public` (or `SWT_DASHBOARD_UNSAFE_PUBLIC=1`) is set. Symmetrical implementation in `packages/cli/src/lib/binding-guard.ts` + `packages/dashboard/src/server/lib/binding-guard.ts`.
  - **AC-01 browser auto-open** via the `open` package (lazy-imported), disabled automatically under `CI=1` or non-TTY.
  - **Performance polish:** server-side `log.append` rate limit at 100 lines/sec with synthetic drop-notice; client-side `ArtifactPreview` virtualization at 500 paragraphs with `Show paragraphs N+1–M of total` pill.
  - **Size + offline guards:** `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` enforces SPA ≤ 80 KB gzipped + daemon ≤ 200 KB raw; `scripts/check-offline.mjs` greps the SPA bundle for forbidden CDN hosts.
  - **Docs:** `docs/swt-dashboard.md` documents the full subcommand surface (flags, env overrides, AC-14 binding guard, AC-01 auto-open, AC-11 offline guarantee, AC-10 size budgets, AC-12 / AC-13 accessibility). README.md links to it.

  **Acceptance criteria addressed:** AC-01, AC-02, AC-03, AC-04, AC-05, AC-06, AC-10, AC-11, AC-12, AC-13, AC-14, AC-15.

  **Quality gate trail:**
  - 4/4 phases QA PASS (5 must-haves per phase, M1–M5).
  - 17/17 UAT CHECKPOINTs PASS across the 4 phases.
  - 94 files modified across the milestone with 0 phase-level deviations.
  - All hard archive gates passed (UAT guard + state-consistency + 7-point audit).

  **Stack additions** (locked at TDD §3, all pinned): `hono@4`, `@hono/node-server@1`, `solid-js@1`, `vite@5`, `chokidar@4`, `gray-matter@4`, unified + remark + rehype family, `@shikijs/rehype`, `open@10`. Tarball growth fits within the +150 KB ceiling (AC-10).

  **Out of scope (v1.6.1):** Playwright e2e suite (3–5 critical paths × Linux + macOS), published `docs.stopwastingtokens.dev/swt-dashboard` site, `axe-cli` automated CI a11y gate. AC-12 / AC-13 verified manually via UAT.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- cceb8ee: v1.5.1 — Codex SDK conformance pass.

  Closes 11 of 17 findings from the Codex SDK verification research at developers.openai.com/codex (Tier 1+2+3); 6 deferred to v1.6+ (Tier 4).

  **Phase 01 — SDK Critical Conformance** (F-01, F-02, F-04):
  - All 6 agent profile TOMLs use documented Codex models: `gpt-5.5` (scout/architect), `gpt-5.3-codex` (lead/dev/qa/debugger). The fictional `gpt-5-codex` identifier no longer appears in product code.
  - All 6 TOMLs declare `model_reasoning_effort` in the documented Codex enum (`minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh`) per role: scout=low, architect=high, lead/dev/qa=medium, debugger=high. SWT Effort tier values (`thorough | balanced | fast | turbo`) no longer leak into Codex schema.
  - All 6 TOMLs declare Codex-required `name` and `description` fields per the subagent schema.
  - New `CodexReasoningEffort` type in `@swt-labs/core` decouples Codex's model thinking budget from SWT's `Effort` tier (planning depth + turn budget).

  **Phase 02 — Plugin Marketplace Prep** (F-03, F-13, F-14):
  - Plugin manifest moved to `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (repo root) per documented Codex path; old `packages/cli/codex-plugin.json` removed.
  - Manifest fields realigned to documented schema: `keywords` (was `tags`), `interface` block with `displayName`/`category`/`screenshots`, `author` as object (not bare string). Undocumented top-level `install`/`commands`/`tags`/`categories` removed.
  - Build-time drift detection asserts `.codex-plugin/plugin.json:version === package.json:version` — version sync caught at every `pnpm test`.

  **Phase 03 — Hook Integration & Drift Cleanup** (F-08, F-09, F-10, F-11):
  - New `emitCodexHooksJson(file)` in `@swt-labs/codex-driver` translates SWT's flat snake_case schema to Codex's nested PascalCase `hooks.json` shape (`hooks.{EventName}: [{matcher, hooks: [{type, command, timeout: 600}]}]`).
  - New `CODEX_HOOK_EVENT_NAMES` translation map (snake_case → PascalCase) covers the 6 v1.0 generic events; SWT's 6 v1.5 SDLC events do NOT translate (filtering implicit by construction).
  - New `emitCodexHooksFeatureFlag()` returns `[features]\ncodex_hooks = true\n` for the user's `~/.codex/config.toml`.
  - All 6 agent TOML header comments now reference `~/.codex/config.toml [mcp_servers.<name>]` (the documented Codex MCP path); old wrong-path text `~/.codex/mcp.json` removed.

  **Build pipeline (publish-blocking fixes for first npm release):**
  - `pnpm build` now produces a working ESM bundle: `dist/cli.mjs` + `dist/cli.d.ts` (paths match `package.json` exports). Previously `pnpm build` was never exercised end-to-end, so the published bundle would have failed at `npm install -g`.
  - Drops CJS output entirely — the package is `"type": "module"`, the `bin` and only realistic consumer is the `swt` CLI; bundled CJS deps with top-level `await` cannot be re-emitted as CJS, and adding a working CJS path adds no value.
  - Stubs `react-devtools-core` (ink's optional dev import) at bundle time so `node dist/cli.mjs` no longer fails with `Cannot find package 'react-devtools-core'`.
  - Adds a `createRequire(import.meta.url)` banner so bundled CJS deps (`cross-spawn` et al.) can `require('child_process')` without the `Dynamic require ... is not supported` runtime error.
  - Adds dedicated `tsconfig.build.json` (no `composite`/`incremental`/`rootDir` constraints) so `dts` build doesn't fail with `TS5074` / `TS6059` on cross-package types.
  - Fixes `packages/cli/src/index.ts` direct-invocation check to use `realpath` + `fileURLToPath` on both sides — the previous check failed on macOS `/tmp -> /private/tmp` and on `npm i -g` bin symlinks, so `swt` from PATH never actually called `main()`.

  **Quality gate trail:**
  - 13/13 user-validated UAT scenarios PASS across 3 phases
  - 11 findings closed at the contract verification + R01 reconciliation + UAT triple-gate
  - All hard archive gates (UAT guard + state-consistency + 7-point audit) passed
  - Pre-existing v1.0 DEV-1D class typecheck failures (route.ts, codex-driver/wrapper.ts:39, codex-driver/toml/emit.ts:54) are documented carryforward, unaffected by this milestone — verified via stash + baseline comparison

  **Out of scope (v1.6+):** F-05 (allowed_mcp_servers), F-06 (max_turns), F-07 (role aliasing), F-12 (HookSubBlockSchema expansion), F-15 (AGENTS.override.md), F-17 (cache-hit measurement test).

All notable changes to stop-wasting-tokens are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Closed in this batch (defensive hardening, post-v1.6.0)

- **F-07 Role aliasing.** `AgentSpec.aliases?: readonly string[]` added; `emitAgentToml` emits the field conditionally so existing TOML output is unchanged when no aliases are declared. Test coverage in `packages/codex-driver/test/toml.test.ts`.
- **F-15 `AGENTS.override.md` support.** `composeAgentsMdBody` + `readAgentsOverrideSync` in `packages/codex-driver/src/agents-md/writer.ts` let users layer project-specific rules into the SWT-managed block without losing them on regeneration. Tests in `packages/codex-driver/test/agents-md.test.ts`.
- **F-17 Agent prompt cache-hit measurement.** `packages/codex-driver/test/cache-hit.test.ts` asserts byte-identical TOML emission across repeated calls (REQ-05 cache-key stability).

### Planned for v1.6.1 / next milestone

- Playwright e2e suite (3–5 critical paths × Linux + macOS) for the localhost dashboard
- `axe-cli` automated CI a11y gate (AC-12 / AC-13)
- Published `docs.stopwastingtokens.dev` site (Mintlify infra)
- Full Claude Code backend driver (12-event hook taxonomy, Agent Teams, isolation modes — REQ-V2-02)
- Full Ollama backend driver (REQ-V2-03)
- Codex Plugin Marketplace submission (REQ-19) — once OpenAI accepts third-party manifests
- Real Codex `subagent`-spawn API wiring once OpenAI publishes the surface (today's `codex exec` wrapper is functionally adequate)
- Auto-derived reference docs (CLI / config / artifacts) generated at build time
- Configurable telemetry cache TTL
- Real HTTP telemetry sender pointing at a hosted analytics endpoint
- Custom Vale rules under `docs/styles/SWT/`
- Hook event taxonomy expansion (`pre_archive`, `post_phase`, `post_uat_fail`)

## [1.0.0] — `<DATE-OF-PUBLISH>`
