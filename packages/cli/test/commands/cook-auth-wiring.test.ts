/**
 * Plan 02-04 (Phase 2 / Selection → Spawn Wiring) — the cook-callsite
 * credential-wiring unit suite.
 *
 * Kept ISOLATED from `cook.test.ts` so the Phase 2 wiring tests are a clean
 * unit. The OS keychain is MOCKED end-to-end: the test mocks
 * `@swt-labs/runtime`'s `resolve-store.ts` directly via its cross-package
 * relative path so the SINGLE mock covers BOTH consumers — the
 * `@swt-labs/runtime` barrel re-export AND the runtime-internal call inside
 * `resolveSpawnCredential` (which lives in `@swt-labs/runtime` since Plan
 * 01-01 / Milestone 12). No real keychain, no real Pi is ever contacted.
 *
 * Coverage:
 *   (a) `loadCookConfig` on a config WITH an `auth` block → `CookConfig.auth`
 *       deep-equals the parsed block.
 *   (b) `loadCookConfig` on a config with NO `auth` block → `auth` is `{}`.
 *   (c) `loadCookConfig` on malformed JSON → `auth` is `{}`.
 *   (d) `resolveSpawnCredential` with a keychain HIT → resolves
 *       `{ provider, resolvedCredential: { authMode, secret } }`.
 *   (e) `resolveSpawnCredential` with NO `auth` entry → resolves `undefined`.
 *   (f) `resolveSpawnCredential` with a keychain MISS → resolves `undefined`,
 *       does NOT throw (graceful degrade).
 *   (g) Secret-leak guard — a spawn driven through `runSpawnWithFallback`
 *       with a resolved credential never surfaces the secret in any captured
 *       `emitCookEvent` payload.
 *   (h) When `config.auth` is empty, the `spawnArgs` handed to the mocked
 *       `spawnFn` carry NO `resolvedCredential` — byte-identical to
 *       pre-Phase-2.
