/**
 * `<Popover>` — the shared open/close-CONTROLLED dropdown popover primitive.
 *
 * Originally `OptionsMenu` was the dashboard's only dropdown and owned this
 * interaction code inline. The "Provider ▾" top-bar menu needs the exact
 * same mechanics (open/close, click-outside dismiss, Escape, focus-on-open,
 * `position: absolute` anchoring) so the fragile listener/dismiss logic is
 * factored HERE and consumed by both `OptionsMenu` and `ProviderMenu` —
 * rather than duplicating a block of subtle event handling.
 *
 * Like `OptionsMenu` was: this is open/close-CONTROLLED — it does NOT read
 * the dashboard store. The parent (`TopBar`) owns the open state + the
 * trigger `ref` and the focus-RETURN to that trigger on close; this
 * component only renders the popover, installs its document listeners while
 * open, and calls `props.onClose()` on dismissal.
 *
 * Accessibility: the popover root is `tabindex={-1}`, receives focus on
 * open, and takes a `role` + `ariaLabel` from the consumer (`OptionsMenu`
 * passes `role="menu"` / `aria-label="Options"`; `ProviderMenu` passes the
 * same shape for its own surface). It is dismissed on Escape and on a click
 * outside the popover-and-trigger.
 *
 * The load-bearing pure helpers (`nextMenuStateOnTriggerClick`,
 * `shouldCloseOnKey`, `shouldCloseOnOutsideClick`) live here so they can be
 * unit-tested in the dashboard's node-env vitest — the workspace has no
 * `@solidjs/testing-library`. `OptionsMenu` re-exports them unchanged so its
 * existing test imports keep resolving.
